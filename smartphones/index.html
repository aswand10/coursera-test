                <p>
                    And then there was Pro. A transformative triple‐camera system that adds tons of capability without complexity. An unprecedented leap in battery life. And a mind‐blowing chip that doubles down on machine learning and pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can do. sWelcome to the first iPhone powerful enough to be called Pro. Take a closer look. Two sizes. Four finishes. Stainless steel and glass design. Pro camera system We’ve three‐upped ourselves.

                <h2>OnePlus 8 Pro</h2>
                <p>
                    The large size and extra display also makes the OnePlus 8 Pro a heavier phone than the OnePlus 8. The OnePlus 8 Pro also comes with a quad camera set up — so there is a 48M main camera, 48MP utrawide angle, an 8MP telephoto offering 3x optical zoom and a 5MP colour filter camera. The selfie camera is 16MP.
